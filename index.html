          <p> Fort or Lal Qila  is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the 
            main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift 
            his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also 
            constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan, and combines Persianate palace
             architecture with Indian traditions.The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nadir Shah's invasion of the 
             Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion
              of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used as a garrison.For more information

                <p> FThe India Gate (formerly known as the All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located astride the Rajpath, on the eastern 
                    edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called Kingsway. It stands as a memorial to 84,000 soldiers of the British
                     Indian Army who died in between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa,
                      Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including 
                      some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate.[2] Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate
                       evokes the architectural style of the memorial arch such as the Arch of Constantine, in Rome, and is often compared to the 
                       Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.

                <p> The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms part of the Qutb complex, which lies at the site of Delhiâ€™s oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs.[3] It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi, India.[4][5] It is one of the most visited tourist spots in the city, mostly built between 1199 and 1220.[6][7][4]

                    It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of 1190, which was constructed a decade or so 
                    before the probable start of the Delhi tower. The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and 
                    geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies" at the 
                    top of each stage. In general, minarets were slow to be used in India and are often detached from the main mosque
                     where they exist
